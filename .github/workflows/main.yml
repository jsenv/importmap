# This file configure a GitHub workflow responsible to perform
# various checks related to the codebase.
#
# For that reason it's runned on every pull request and push to main.
#
# It does the following:
#  - Check lint passes (no eslint error on files)
#  - Check tests passes (none is failing)
#  - Upload code coverage from tests to codecov
#
# If all these steps are passing the workflow ends up
# publishing package on npm if needed. It will publish the npm package
# using the token found in secrets.NPM_TOKEN. Be sure to create this
# token in the GitHub repository.
#
# If you want to update this file it's recommended to use
# a YAML validator such as https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml
