# package-lock.json is generated by "npm install".
# It's a good practice to have it tracked by git.
# In practice tracking this file is a pain: git conflicts and random errors.
# Maybe today npm is finally stable and does not randomly fail when package-lock.json
# is tracked by git. Until it's tested again and confirmed I prefer
# to ignore package-lock.json.
